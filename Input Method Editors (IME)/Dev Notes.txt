IMEs are an important part of developing systems for typing Indic scripts fast and efficiently.
Making good progress for the IME for Devanagari.
Making this paves the path for making more IMEs for Indic scripts such as Thai.
The large character count in Thai will likely necessitate the development of such an IME aside from the keyboard layout.
Vowels have to be used with {u+codes}.

** Bug regarding the wrong consonant being sent when sending conjunct clusters, likely related to the caps lock settings.

Making comments inside the IME is possible as such;

*?OZ‖'	‖MSI‖En‖ʼ¦{U+035C}{double breve}‖'
Only the character {U+035C} will be sent by the IME, the typist will be able to see what it says in the curly brackets.
