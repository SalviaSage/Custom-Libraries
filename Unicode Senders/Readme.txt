The aim behind these libraries is being able to type extra characters
by spelling out what they are, for example, if you type ^^^dollar you get $

I picked the caret symbol as a trigger-string because it was the most obscure of all the characters located in the 
keyboard. That way, it wouldn't be accidentally triggered.

The use can enable and disable the libraries as they wish and I try to make it so that they are compatible in use
with the other unicode senders. I understand that they may overlap one another.
