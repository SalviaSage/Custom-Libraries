The aim behind these libraries is being able to type extra characters
by spelling out what they are, for example, if you type ^dollar and hit the spacebar you get $

I picked the caret symbol as a trigger-string because it was the most obscure of all the characters located in the 
keyboard and it looked like an insertion point. That way, it wouldn't be accidentally triggered.

The user can enable and disable the libraries that they want as they wish from Hotstrings.exe 
and I try to make it so that they are compatible with the other Unicode senders.

I understand that they may overlap one another.
