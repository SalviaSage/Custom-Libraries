Input Method Editors (IME)s — Help Documentation;

These libraries give us IMEs (Input Method Editors). 
They are menus that pop up under the caret which allow us to choose extra letters and characters.
They are necessary for languages and writing systems with too many different characters and diacritics.
For example, the Ethiopian writing system has over four hundred and fifty characters, each with a different Unicode codepoint.
That makes it impossible to type them all directly from the keyboard.

So for example, in Vietnamese IME, we type (a) then hit the pre-defined trigger key, which I set to the (TAB) key.

Then we see a menu which lists:
	1. á
	2. à
	3. ả
	4. ã
	5. ạ
Then, we hit the number key on the keyboard;
for example, hitting (3) will delete the (a) that we wrote and will type (ả).
This keyboard selection only works for the top row number keys, does not work with the numpad, and only works up to key (7).
We can also select the entry from the list with the mouse click.
Up to 20 entries are supported without support for page tabbing.

However, there is a bug related to spacing and you will see extra space being typed along with the character that we want to send.
This problem affects the tenth entry from the list going up to the last entry on the list.
This problem can be overcome by using the {Left 2}{BS}{Right} syntax.

For triggers where there is only one entry in the menu, the menu can be cancelled altogether in favour of automatic conversion upon pressing the trigger key.
This is achieved by changing the 'MSI' syntax to 'SI' syntax in the library file.

The correct syntax for IMEs: '*?OZ' the entered characters have to be followed by the character tabulation character.
It is '*C?OZ' for making case-sensitive triggers.
