# Custom-Libraries
Here, I host the custom library files I made for the program hotstrings.exe

They work alongside this computer program developed by a Polish author:
https://github.com/mslonik/Hotstrings

What they do is, they are "helper" files that are supposed to be used alongside
the keyboard layout programs that I make as well as independent libraries that can be used on their own.

For example, if you write ^dollarsign you will get `$`.
There are also "typer helpers" that automatically fix certain typing mistakes and other automatic corrections.
All made possibble by this computer program.

I had the plan and the idea to do these for months but I didn't have a computer program for doing so.
Maciej is the person who made it possible for me to bring my ideas into programmatic reality.

Thanks Maciej.
