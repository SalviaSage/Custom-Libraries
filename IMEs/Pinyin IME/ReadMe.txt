A fast way to write Pinyin.
Featuring a drop-down menu for the extra vowels.

Basically, this is a custom library for the program hotstrings.exe
You just place this library file (.csv file) into the libraries directory.

Then, make sure that the library is enabled in the libraries menu of the program.
The library file name is (IME) Pinyin (experimental).csv

Then, type normally.
When you type the vowel letters, you can then hit the triggerstring hotkey which should be set to the TAB key.
This will trigger the menu.
This is essential for typing Pinyin because of its tonal vowels.
An IME (a drop down menu) is necessary due to the large number of vowel letters.

There is however, an inherent problem with the Hotstrings.exe whereby, the list
of entries that we can pick from, after the tenth entry, puts an unintentional spacebar character before the letter that we want.
It does not do that for the first 10 entries. I am not the author of the program but I may be able to fix it later.

Pinyin however has less than 10 variations for vowels, so it is not affected by this problem.
