;; Immediate execute (*) should not be used with IMEs.
;; They have to be case sensitive (C) with separate case definitions.
;; There is a bug where space is sent before the characters starting from the tenth entry.
;; The correct syntax for fixing this bug is the character followed by the {Left 2}{BS}{Right} syntax.
