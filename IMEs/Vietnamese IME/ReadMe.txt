A fast way to write Vietnamese.
Featuring a drop-down menu for the extra vowels.

Basically, this is a custom library for the program hotstrings.exe
You just place this library file (.csv file) into the libraries directory.

Then, make sure that the library is enabled in the libraries menu of the program.

Then, type normally.
When you type the vowel letters it will give you a drop down list where you can pick
the letter that you want to type.
This is essential for typing Vietnamese because of its tonal vowels.
An IME (a drop down menu) is necessary due to the large number of vowel letters.

There is however, an inherent problem with the Hotstrings.exe whereby, the list
of entries that we can pick from, after the tenth entry, puts an unintentional spacebar character before the letter that we want.
It does not do that for the first 10 entries. I am not the author of the program but I may be able to fix it later.

The Alternative version, has up to 19-20 entries per vowel letter, but it is buggy due to the aforementioned reason.
The regular version has up to 6 entries to represent the tones. But, the extra letters are not included.

To get around this problem, we can install the Vietnamese keyboard layout found here:
https://github.com/SalviaSage/Keyboard-Layouts/tree/master/Latin%20Typers/Vietnamese%20Typer

That keyboard layout does kill some of the inherent keys of the keyboard to give us all of the letters used in the Vietnamese alphabet.
While removing the letters from the keyboard that are not used in Vietnamese spelling anyway.
However, it does not give us any way to type the tone markers. This IME library however gives us the means to type the tone markers.

So, using that keyboard layout and plus using this IME library along with Hotstrings.exe is a sure way of typing in Vietnamese.
It is rather efficient and easy even if it is not perfect and it is fully inclusive.

This is my first attempt at making an IME, and it is subject to further development.
