Maatra Typers — Help Documentation:

I created these Hotstrings.exe libraries to tackle an issue with typing vowels in the Devanagari script
and in other Indic scripts.

In the Devanagari alphabet, vowels can be written in 2 ways. The independent vowel forms and the maatra forms.
(https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/matra)

In the computer programs I created to type Indic scripts, I assigned the vowel keys to type the maatra forms while pressing caps lock + vowel keys give us the independent vowel forms. While pressing shift + vowel keys give us long maatra forms.

This seemed like a good idea since Indic scripts are caseless, which give us the ability to use the caps lock key as an extra modifier key. However, this makes it so that the maatras are also typed at the start of words where the independent vowel forms would be. For example, you wanted to type उत्तर , but you got ुत्तार instead. This mistake would never be done if writing with a pen and paper. In this scenario, this is done intentionally since the maatra and the independent vowels are treated as different letters by the computer. And the computer has no way of telling where the start of words are to automate this matter. At the start of words, the maatras would never be used. So, what this custom library does is that it automatically detects and deletes the starting maatras and replaces them with their independent vowel forms.

There are twenty-three definitions here for tackling this problem in the Devanagari script and I like to think that it is an indispensable program for typing with the Devanagari script and other Indic scripts that are affected by this problem.

This custom library is based on the program found here: https://github.com/mslonik/Hotstrings
I am not the author of this program and that program is in active development as of writing this.
